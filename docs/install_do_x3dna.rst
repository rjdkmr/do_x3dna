do_x3dna requires GROMACS-2023.

Steps
+++++
Follow these steps to install do_x3dna

.. code-block:: bash

    cd do_x3dna
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..  -DGMX_PATH=/opt/gromacs -DGMX_SRC=/path/to/gromacs-2025.x -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/do_x3dna
    make
    sudo make install


Directory ``/opt/gromacs`` should contains ``include`` and ``lib`` directories.
Gromacs version will be automatically detected and accordingly processed during
compilations.

  * ``-DGMX_PATH`` : path to GROMACS installation directory.

  * ``-DGMX_SRC`` : path to GROMACS source code directory downloaded from GROMACS download page.

  * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``: path to a directory where do_x3dna will be installed.
    If this option is not provided, do_x3dna will install either in ``/usr/local/bin``
    or in ``$HOME/bin`` directory.

  * Instead of ``GMX_PATH``, ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` can be used before running cmake as follows:

      * ``export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/gromacs``
      * ``export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/gromacs:/path/to/fftw``

  * In case of **ERROR**: **FFTW library file libfftw3f.so or libfftw3f.a not found...**
    use ``-DFFTW_LIB=/path/to/fftw/lib/`` to give a path for the directory containing either of the two files.
